## The Fellows reflect on Open Access Week
The theme of this year's [Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org) is "Open for Whom", which inspired us to reflect on what Open Access means, why it is important, and especially how the *people* are (positively and negatively) affected by openness in science. Below you will find short thoughts from our four Fellows:

### Sele
The privilege of science. We speak from the opening of the production of knowledge, however many times we do not analyze what it really means how privileged this access is. Open Access to whom? Could we also add the "by whom"? What do we produce, what do we share, who enables this? This week leaves me more doubts and reflections, because it is not enough to think about who we deposit the knowledge to, we have to analyze our place from where we stand when we share it. 

### Monica 
Open science touts the tantalizing prospect of making science accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world. Yet simply making data and code freely available doesn’t make science easier to access for everyone, everywhere. To me this year’s Open Access Week theme is challenging the open science community to think about how we rebuild the inequitable system we are dismantling. How do we make science both physically reachable and comprensible, while not putting the burden of transforming the system on marginalized groups? These are, perhaps, the most important questions for the open science community and we must address them before we can hope of making real progressive change to the way knowledge is created and shared. 

### Ouso
**Open Access Week** is an important event for open access awareness. It is to highlight advances in the realms of modern scientific research practices and communication. But, I wish one thing for you this week, that Open Access (OA) should bother you. Is your scientific practise in line with it? The week’s theme question - _**“Open for whom?”**_ eagerly arrested my attention; what is its meaning from my perspective? I would love to pick your mind on it too, but I’ll stick to mine for this bit. Foremost, let me clarify, in its classical meaning OA is unrestricted access to literature, yet here I will mean unrestricted access to all products of research, more or less synonymous to Open Science. My personal summary of it is _#NROA – No Restrictions, Only Attribution_. However, I must remind us of the need to remain ethical which, I think, is an aspect of the “for whom?”. This question insinuates that certain risks are associated with openness, signalling a red light, and inevitably invoking fear. The fears are chiefly fuelled by ignorance on the many protective options available with openness. In most of my interactions regarding openness, the elephant in the room is **security**. Of the common triad of Open Science, Open- access (literature), source, and data, the latter is most affected with regards to security. Some people profit from data without consent, at the expense of the public. Also, mainly from the aspect of the former two, some researchers have feared the hijacking of their in-development ideas from open spaces, missing out on well-deserved recognition/attribution. This has led only to preferential access to closed research groups. Openness is very welcoming, attracting with it people/entities with good and bad intentions indiscriminately, but mitigations have been put or are in the process of being put in place. Such include data protection [laws](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3381593), [policies](https://www.who.int/ethics/research/en/) for anonymisation and confidentiality in research, portals for [preregistration](https://cos.io/prereg/) of research ideas and design, and micro-publishers like [flushPub](https://www.flashpub.io/about) for quick sharing of knowledge.
