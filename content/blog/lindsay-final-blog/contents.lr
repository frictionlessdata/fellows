## The End is Nigh

I still have trouble wrapping my brain around the idea that I was accepted into the [Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research Fellows Programme](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/). While I learned a fair amount about the [Frictionless Suite of Tools](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/), Open Science, and how to advocate for open science, the thing I valued most about this opportunity was getting to work with the other Fellows and build confidence in my own skills as a Data Librarian.  I enjoyed collaborating with the other [Frictionless Fellows on our Frictionless Fellows Workshop 2022](https://zenodo.org/record/6578621#.YrtHB3bMJ9A). Additionally, Lilly helped me write a proposal to present on my work in the Fellowship at the [Research Data Access and Preservation Association (RDAP) Summit 2022](https://osf.io/meetings/rdap2022). My presentation, [Making Libraries for Everyone: Building a Reproducible Workflow to Assess Classification](https://osf.io/uf6qh/), was accepted. Presenting at RDAP was an amazing opportunity for me, and I am not sure I would have had a presentation accepted without being a Frictionless Fellow. I also submitted an article to the [Journal of eScience Librarianship](https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/jeslib/)'s special edition on the RDAP Summit 2022. If the article is accepted, it will be my first solo publication in a peer reviewed journal. I greatly enjoyed the opportunities afforded to me as a Frictionless Fellow, and look forward to promoting Open Science in my career as a Data Librarian.  Thank you!
